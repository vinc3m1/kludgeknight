**Unofficial web-based key remapper for Royal Kludge keyboards**

Remap any key on your Royal Kludge keyboard directly in your browser. No installation required.

üåê **[Try it now at kludgeknight.com](https://www.kludgeknight.com/)**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: This is unofficial software and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to Royal Kludge in any way. Use at your own risk.

> **Note**: This software has only been tested on the Royal Kludge F68 keyboard. While the key mappings are sourced from the official RK software and should work with other RK keyboards, functionality on other models has not been verified.

## ‚ú® Features

- üåê **Runs in your browser** - No downloads or installation
- üéπ **Visual keyboard layout** - See your keyboard and click to remap
- üîÑ **Live updates** - Changes apply immediately to your hardware
- üîí **Privacy first** - Everything happens locally, no data sent anywhere
- üó∫Ô∏è **Key mappings from official RK software** - Keyboard layouts and configurations pulled from the official Royal Kludge app

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Limitation

**The app cannot read your existing key mappings from the keyboard.** Due to firmware limitations, we can only write new mappings, not read what's currently set.

This means:
- If you've already remapped keys using RK software, those mappings won't be visible here
- The app always starts with the default keyboard layout
- Any remapping you do will overwrite what's currently on the keyboard

Any Royal Kludge keyboard that works with the official RK software should be supported. The keyboard configurations are [pulled directly from the official RK Windows app](https://github.com/vinc3m1/rk-web/tree/main/public/rk/Dev), so if your keyboard works with the official software, it should work here too.

### Is my data safe?

Yes! Everything happens locally in your browser. No data is sent to any server. Your keyboard mappings are saved directly to your keyboard's hardware.

### Can I use this on multiple computers?

Yes! Once you remap your keys, the settings are stored in your keyboard's memory. They'll work on any computer, even without this app.

### Does it work on Mac/Linux?

Yes, as long as you're using a supported browser (Chrome, Edge, or Opera).

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Keyboard not detected?**
- Make sure you're using Chrome, Edge, or Opera
- Try a different USB port or cable
- Check that your keyboard is in wired mode (not Bluetooth)
